// Edit this file to define your hunt. Add as many steps as you need.
// destinationkey accepts a fixed MMDDYYYY string (including leading zeroes),
// 'currentdate', or a relative year expression like 'currentdate - 21years'.
// Example: on October 8, 2026, 'currentdate - 21years' resolves to '10082005'.
// Both + and - are supported; spaces and singular 'year' are also accepted.
// Relative dates follow the player's local date, including after midnight.
// February 29 becomes February 28 if the target year is not a leap year.
// Use 'currentdate' on the last step to return players to today.
// Wrap messages in double quotes so apostrophes (like we'll) work normally.
// If your clue contains a double quote, escape it as \".
// Keep each quoted message on one physical line. Use \n for a line break
// and \n\n for a blank line between paragraphs.
// Upload clips to images/ and set each step's clip to its path from index.html.
// Use forward slashes (e.g. 'images/bttfTimeTravel.mp4'). Steps can share a clip.
// The clip plays when leaving that step after entering its correct destination.
